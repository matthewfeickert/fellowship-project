There are examples of how to use the tool in the form of Jupyter notebooks in the `Notebooks` directory.

## Project Timeline

- **May 8th through May 21st**

  - [x] Create a GitHub repository for the project.
  - [ ] Design a template for binned models that is parametrized in terms of number of events, number of bins, number of channels, number of signal/background components, and number of parameters of interest and nuisance parameters.
  - [ ] Begin documentation of the template model on the GitHub repository.

- May 22nd through June 4th

  - [ ] Establish a precise mathematical formulation that is implementation-independent based on the `HistFactory` schema.
  - [ ] Begin study of data flow graph frameworks or of probabilistic programming frameworks.
  - [ ] Implement the template for the benchmark models with a `HistFactory` script.

- June 5th through June 18th

  - [ ] Conclude from study of data flow graph frameworks or of probabilistic programming frameworks which framework to pursue.
  - [ ] Begin implementation of the benchmark models in the selected framework.
  - [ ] Begin to write technical report.

- June 19th through July 2nd

  - [ ] Finish implementation of the benchmark models in the selected framework.
  - [ ] Apply benchmarks evaluating framework data and model parallelism.

- July 3rd through July 16th

  - [ ] Finish technical report.
  - [ ] Create tutorial on data flow graphs targeted for physicists.

- July 17th through August 8th

  - [ ] Upstream software contributions to address the identified limitations (if any).
  - [ ] Development of/Contribution to a probabilistic framework (if time permits).
